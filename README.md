# Nginx Log Analyzer

This project provides a shell script that analyzes an Nginx access log file and extracts the top 5 most frequent IP addresses, paths, response status codes, and user agents. The analysis is done using common Linux utilities like `awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `head`.

## Requirements

- Linux-based system (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
- Shell environment (Bash)
- Access to a terminal
- Nginx access log file (e.g., `logs.txt`)
